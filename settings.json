      "text":"# Conventional Commits 1.0.0\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with [SemVer](http://semver.org/), by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.\n\nThe commit message should be structured as follows:\n\n* * * * *\n\n```\n<type>[optional scope]: <description>\n\n[optional body]\n\n[optional footer(s)]\n```\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:\n\n1. **fix:** a commit of the *type* `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with [`PATCH`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).\n2. **feat:** a commit of the *type* `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with [`MINOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).\n3. **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [`MAJOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any *type*.\n4. *types* other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, for example [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) (based on the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)) recommends `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.\n5. *footers* other than `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` may be provided and follow a convention similar to [git trailer format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers).\n\nAdditional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commit's type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Commit message with description and breaking change footer\n\n```\nfeat: allow provided config object to extend other configs\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files\n```\n\n### Commit message with `!` to draw attention to breaking change\n\n```\nfeat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped\n```\n\n### Commit message with scope and `!` to draw attention to breaking change\n\n```\nfeat(api)!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped\n```\n\n### Commit message with both `!` and BREAKING CHANGE footer\n\n```\nchore!: drop support for Node 6\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript features not available in Node 6.\n```\n\n### Commit message with no body\n\n```\ndocs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG\n```\n\n### Commit message with scope\n\n```\nfeat(lang): add Polish language\n```\n\n### Commit message with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers\n\n```\nfix: prevent racing of requests\n\nIntroduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss\nincoming responses other than from latest request.\n\nRemove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are\nobsolete now.\n\nReviewed-by: Z\nRefs: #123\n```\n\n## Specification\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).\n\n1. Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, `feat`, `fix`, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL `!`, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.\n2. The type `feat` MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.\n3. The type `fix` MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.\n4. A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., `fix(parser):`\n5. A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., *fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string*.\n6. A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.\n7. A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.\n8. One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a `:<space>` or `<space>#` separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the [git trailer convention](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers)).\n9. A footer's token MUST use `-` in place of whitespace characters, e.g., `Acked-by` (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for `BREAKING CHANGE`, which MAY also be used as a token.\n10. A footer's value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.\n11. Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.\n12. If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., *BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files*.\n13. If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a `!` immediately before the `:`. If `!` is used, `BREAKING CHANGE:` MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.\n14. Types other than `feat` and `fix` MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., *docs: update ref docs.*\n15. The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.\n16. BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer."
